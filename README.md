# Political Orientation and Gender Equality Awareness
Data analysis of the Taiwan Social Change Survey (2022 Gender Module), exploring the relationship between political orientation and gender equality attitudes. Includes data preprocessing, gender equality index construction, ANOVA, regression models, chi-square tests, and moderation analysis.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes data from the Taiwan Social Change Survey (2022 Gender Module) to explore the relationship between political orientation and gender equality awareness.
I constructed a Gender Equality Index from survey items and applied multiple statistical methods (ANOVA, regression, chi-square tests, moderation models) to investigate how political orientation interacts with gender equality attitudes.
Key findings suggest that political orientation is not directly associated with gender equality awareness. Instead, age and education are the most important influencing factors, with political orientation moderating these relationships

## Methodology
1. Data Source
- Taiwan Social Change Survey (TSCS, 2022 Gender Module)
- Contains both gender equality items and presidential voting orientation
2. Gender Equality Index Construction
- Based on multiple Likert-scale survey questions
- Reverse-coded items where appropriate
- Cronbachâ€™s Alpha = 0.86, indicating high internal reliability
3. Statistical Analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): demographic distributions, descriptive statistics
- ANOVA: tested categorical factors against the Gender Equality Index
- Regression (GLM): tested continuous predictors (age, years of education)
- Chi-Square Tests: examined significant differences across political orientation groups
- Moderation Models: tested the interaction between political orientation and age/education
4. Limitations
- Cross-sectional data cannot capture long-term causal relationships
- Simplified operationalization of political orientation and gender equality
- Potential omitted variables (e.g., social status, media exposure)

## Key Findings
1. Gender equality awareness is higher among women, younger respondents, urban residents, and those with higher education.
2. Political orientation alone is not a strong predictor of gender equality awareness.
3. However, political orientation moderates the relationship between age/education and gender equality attitudes. (Example: younger, more educated supporters of Tsai Ing-wen scored higher on gender equality than comparable groups in other camps.)

## Future Directions
1. Incorporate longitudinal (panel) survey data to track trends over time
2. Add more explanatory variables (e.g., socioeconomic status, religious beliefs, media exposure)
3. Use text mining and content analysis to study party discourse on gender equality
4. Extend to comparative East Asian datasets for cross-country analysis
